Abstract
Traffic sign dataset is one of the important elements of CNN based TS-recognition system. 
Existing  datasets include European and American signs while in many projects we need persian signs.
 Infact these signs may have main differences in different countries, because of that for the first time
 in Iran, for implementing persian traffic signs recognition system, we gathered and prepared
 “Persian Traffic Sign Dataset” which is called as PTSD. This dataset consists of more than 14 thousand 
cropped traffic signs images in 43 classes for recognition task.
 In addition to training data, we prepared 2421  imges for testing phase. 
All images of this collection were taken from the real and natural environments such as 
streets, highways and roads from different parts of Iran. The advantage of this dataset 
over similar datasets is the variety of imaging environments, angles, distances and image
 quality, also in contrary to others, in this dataset different cameras are used for imaging.
